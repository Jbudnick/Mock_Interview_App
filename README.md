# Mock Interview Question Generator

<img src="https://blog.gurock.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/interview.png" style="height:200px;text-align: center:">

This project has been rebuilt in javascript and hosted [here](https://jbudnick.github.io/Mock_Interview_App), due to my AWS free tier ending and the cost of running an AWS EC2 instance. This new version has the same features as the original.

The python version of the mock interview app is available. To use it, please download the [Interview App](https://github.com/Jbudnick/Mock_Interview_App/archive/refs/heads/non-aws.zip) file, open it, and run "Interview_App.py"
