Unfortunately, due to my AWS free tier ending and the cost of running an AWS EC2 instance, the AWS web app for this project has been deactivated indefinitely.

However, the python version of the mock interview app still works. To use it, please download the [Interview App](https://github.com/Jbudnick/Mock_Interview_App/archive/refs/heads/non-aws.zip) file, open it, and run "Interview_App.py"
