#Module 1: Programming, Databases and Big Data, Statistics

Explain how you have used version control in your data science projects. Have you been able to collaborate on developing code with a partner? How about a group? How did you do it? What workflow did you use?
What have you used as your development environment? In your opinion when should scripts and jupyter notebooks be used?

In your Python code, when do you choose to us a functional vs. object oriented approach? What are the functional and object-oriented paradigms?

Compare and contrast SQL and noSQL databases. What is one major organizational difference betweeen the two? What data do you consider ideal for each? How have you used each type of database?
Explain the concept of MapReduce in simple to understand language. How does MapReduce help analyze data that's distributed?
Our company presently uses MapReduce, but we've heard that Spark is better. Why is that? And how does Spark work with and return results on distributed data?
Statistics
What's your favorite statistical distribution? Why? Explain how you've used it in your data science work.
What's a confidence interval? Explain how you might calculate one for a mean, using two very different methods.
Explain, step-by-step, how you would perform a frequentist hypothesis test.
Our last hypothesis test was underpowered. What's statistical power? If we were to try our test again, what could we do to increase our power?
What's the difference between probability and statistics?

#Module 2: Supervised/Unsupervised Machine Learning

Supervised Learning - Regression (specifically)
Give an example of when you've applied linear regression in the past where interpretability of the coefficients was a priority. What did you do to ensure that you had reliable coefficients?
What is the difference between linear and logistic regression, and how do you interpret the coefficients for each type of model?
Explain how regularization helps prevent overfitting in a linear/logistic regression. What are the different types of regularization, and how is the cost function different for each type?
In logistic regression, maximum likelihood estimation is used to determine the feature coefficients. Can you explain, at a high level, how MLE works? Feel free to make this specific to a binary classifier.
What metrics might you use to describe how well your linear regression fits the data. What are the pro and cons of each metric?

#Supervised Learning

What is the bias/variance trade-off in supervised machine learning? What process do you follow to ensure your model generalizes well to unseen data?
Explain how the decision tree (classification) algorithm works.
How does a random forest differ from a single decision tree? Why are its predictions more generalizable?
What is an ensemble method? What ensemble models do you know? How does each achieve a low-bias, low-variance prediction?
You're working on a classification model and getting poor accuracy on your test set. What next steps would you consider?

#Unsupervised Learning

Describe a text processing project you've completed. How did you featurize the data?
Given a dataset with 1000s of features, what can you do to reduce its dimensionality?
What's the difference between hard and soft clustering. What models might you try in each case?
How would you explain a latent topic to a layperson?

How do you evaluate the performance of an unsupervised model?
How is string interpolation performed?
What is the difference between “is” and “==”?
Does python call by reference or call by value?
What is your favorite library in Python?
How would you round a number to 3 decimal places?
What is the difference between dictionaries and JSON?
How to combine two lists into a list of tuples?
This depends on how we want the elements in each list arranged into tuples - do we want the list of tuples as follows: the first element in the list to consist of a type of the first element in each list? If so, are the two lists equal? Assuming this, this is how I would approach this issue. create an empty list defined as tuple_list, then a for list : for i in len(list1): tuple_list.append((list1[i], list2[i]).
How can you sort a dictionary by key, alphabetically?
Why would you use enumerate() when iterating on a sequence?
Return a list of keys from a dictionary.

#INTEGRITY/HONESTY
Discuss a time when your integrity was challenged. How did you handle it?
During a difficult lab report, I knew someone who knew someone who had done the lab last semester and could send me the completed lab report to make it easier for me. However, I knew this would not be right since it would most likely be copying and taking someone else’s work. Although this offer was tempting, it was not ethical so that was a deal breaker for me. I handled this situation by politely rejecting this offer and doing the lab on my own.
During a class project that I worked on last year in designing trailer cabinets for motorsports enterprise teams, it was my role to discuss the conclusions and recommendations portion of our project for our final presentation. When critically examining any imperfections of our work, I resolved to state that in order to come up with an even better solution in the future for this project, as a team we would have spent more time face to face with enterprise team leaders in order to get more feedback in terms of what criteria they would like to see in their trailer cabinets, that way we could come up with a menu of solutions specialized to each specific team’s needs instead of relying solely on information they gave us through email. I had a teammate who objected to this, and told me to instead say that the project could have been improved if we were given a larger budget, that way it sounds like it’s the project stakeholders fault instead of ours that our project could have been better. I handled it by explaining that the budget had nothing to do with any imperfections in our project, and went with my original plan. The result was no negative feedback based on this answer and an excellent grade in the class regardless of the imperfection of the final result.
Tell me about a time when you experienced a loss for doing what is right. How did you react?
 
#INTERPERSONAL SKILLS
Describe a situation where you found yourself dealing with someone who didn't like you. How did you handle it?
Tell me about a time when you had to work on a team with someone you did not get along with. What happened?
Stay respectful of the person and their viewpoints, don’t sink to their level. If they aren’t doing their fair share of the work, pull the person aside in private and see if there’s a reason why and if there’s anything that the team can do to motivate this member to put forth their best effort to contribute to the group. If after this step the team member still doesn’t contribute, I will closely monitor their progress and make suggestions for improving their work output. If all else fails, the work will still need to be done, and I will have to redistribute the work to the participating group members.
In extreme cases, I would alert a higher authority such as our boss or our professor, but only as a very last resort.
Describe a situation where you had a conflict with another individual, and how you dealt with it. What was the outcome? How did you feel about it?
During my human powered vehicle project, I worked with a team member who was consistently brought the team off task and insulted everyone else’s ideas.  I handled it by resisting these insults and doing my best to keep the team on task, sometimes pulling this team member aside and making them aware of the damage they are causing to the team. The result was somewhat positive, as in I saw a change in this teammate’s performance
