21,What is the largest dataset you have ever worked with?
22,Give an example of when you've applied linear regression in the past where interpretability of the coefficients was a priority. What did you do to ensure that you had reliable coefficients?
23,"What is the difference between linear and logistic regression, and how do you interpret the coefficients for each type of model?"
24,"Explain how regularization helps prevent overfitting in a linear/logistic regression. What are the different types of regularization, and how is the cost function different for each type?"
